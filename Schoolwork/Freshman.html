                        Worked in a team of four to reverse engineer a product placed in front of us, and recreate it as a CAD rendering. 
                        Me and another student took the responsibility of creating the product in CAD while our other teammates helped write a 
                        report on potential flaws and improvements to the system. We used SolidWorks to create the CAD renderings.

                <h4>Baseball Reaction Time Tester Game</h4>
                <div class="info-list">
                    <p>
                        As part of a team project, we were tasked with developing a device based on the concept of reaction time testing. 
                        We designed and built a baseball-themed reaction time game using an Arduino microcontroller. 
                        The game simulates a baseball pitch, where the user initiates the game by pressing a button and must release it as quickly as possible 
                        when the pitch is "thrown"â€”indicated by a central LED turning green. The user's reaction time determines the outcome: 
                        if the release is within the target range, the LED turns green to signal a successful hit; otherwise, it turns red to indicate a miss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To enhance gameplay, we implemented a scoring system that classifies hits as singles, doubles, or triples based on how quickly the user reacts. 
                        Corresponding LEDs light up to represent the bases, and an LCD screen displays the current score and feedback on the user's performance.
