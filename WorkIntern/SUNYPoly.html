                <h4>Testing and Integrating Packaged ReRAM Devices into a Line Following Robot using Vector Matrix Multiplication</h4>
                <p>This project can be broken into two main components: Testing and Integrating packaged ReRAM devices. I collaborated with another undergraduate, 
                    with my primary focus being on testing and his on integration. Despite our individual areas of focus,
                    we worked closely together and both contributed to the overall success of the project.</p>
                <p>Testing the devices involved using a sourcemeter, programmed in Python, to apply voltage to the devices and measure the resulting current.
                    This allowed us to graph the results and analyze the devices' behavior, enabling us to determine the devices with the least amount of flaws.
                </p>
                <p>For the integration phase, the devices were implemented into a line-following robot. An Arduino was used to control the motors, while the decision making logic
                    was implemented through vector-matrix multiplication using the ReRAM devices. Three sensors served as inputs
                    producing two output signals from the device. The robot's steering direction was determined by the difference between the two output signals.
